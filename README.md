# Heart-disease-prediction
Heart diseases still kill millions of people around the world every year, and this highlights a pressing need for more affordable and timely diagnostic means. Although traditional diagnostic tests offer accurate results, they are often based on specialized equipment, considerable cost, and long waiting timesâ€”posing barriers that can hamper timely interventions. Machine learning methods provide strong alternatives by employing easily accessible patient information to look for patterns tied to cardiovascular danger. This repo focuses specifically on the use of ensemble learning techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Stacking) on datasets of different sizes, in order to study the accuracy and stability of each of them.
